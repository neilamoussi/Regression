# Regression
Regression Project

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
We will use the sales data in 2015 collected by BigMart for 1559 products across 9 stores in different cities. The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, we will try to understand and define the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

<h2>Installation</h2>
We will use the following software and python libraries :   
Python version 3.7  
Matplotib
Numpy    
Pandas 
Scikit learn   
Seaborn   

<h2>Project fils Description</h2>

**Ttrain_CSRqzyo.csv**: Train dataset  
**test_wYRkl1c.csv** : Test dataset  
**output.csv**: Output / Target Variable solution 
**Regression_project.ipynb** :  main file of the project, it demonstrates the steps taken in predictive modeling.
 

<h2>Modeling</h2>

**Decision Tree**

Initial Analysis of Data  
Univariate Analysis    
Bivaraite Analysis  
Missing Value Treatment    
Outlier Treatment   
Variable Transformation   
Modeling    

<h2>Output</h2>

Analysed the train and test data. Build a model to identify key role in increasing sales.
