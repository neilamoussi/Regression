# Regression-Projet
AI & ML Black belt Introduction to Data Science Regression Project

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

<h2>Installation</h2>
The project used the following software and python libraries :   
Python version 3.6  
Numpy    
Pandas    
Matplotib  
Seaborn   
Scikit learn   

<h2>File Description</h2>

**Regression_project.ipynb** : is the main file of the project, it demonstrates the steps taken in predictive modeling.
**test_wYRkl1c.csv** : Test dataset  
**Ttrain_CSRqzyo.csv**: Train dataset  
**output.csv**: Target Variable solution  

<h2>Model</h2>

**Decision Tree**

<h2>Methodology</h2>

Initial Analysis of Data  
Univariate Analysis    
Bivaraite Analysis  
Missing Value Treatment    
Outlier Treatment   
Variable Transformation   
Modeling    

<h2>Result</h2>

Analysed the train and test data. Build a model to identify key role in increasing sales.
